    "# Part 1: Measuring drain time for microchannels of different dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "You will measure and record the fill time of liquids in microfluidic channels with different dimensions. Here, fill time is defined as the time it takes for the liquid to reach the outlet from the moment it begins entering the inlet. Fill time is also commonly referred to as \"drain time\" in microfluidic experiments. For this assignment, the term \"drain time\" is used synonymously with \"fill time\". In Parts 2-7, you will calculate the theoretical drain times and compare them with the experimental results, exploring how microchannel dimensions and liquid properties affect flow behavior in microfluidic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each chip has 6 channels, consisting of 3 different types with 2 replicates of each. You will conduct experiments using a pre-mixed dye solution containing a surfactant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not to worry if some channels fail; you will not be graded on your success rate. This is also part of the reason we've provided you with two replicates of each type. If any channels fail, you can reflect on why they did so (ie. print defects, bubbles, etc.). If all your channels fail, you can obtain data from a neighbor to complete your analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Channel Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have provided the dimensions (in a table) and a CAD screenshot for the channels on the microfluidic chips. Note that these rectangular channels are configured to serpentine so they can all fit on a chip. You will measure and record drain time for each channel, and compare the measured values to the theoretical ones later on in the lab. Partner with someone and compare your drain times. We have provided you space in this table to record drain times.  We recommend also writing these measurements down outside of this notebook to avoid any saving issues and loss of data.\n",

    "### Materials\n",
    "- Resin-printed microfluidic chip(s) sealed with hydrophobic cover tape (ARseal 90697, Adhesives Research, Glen Rock, Pennsylvania, USA)\n",
    "- Pre-mixed dye solution (1% amaranth w/v in 1× PBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 v/v). \n",
    "    - Plasma activation, though common, requires a plasma chamber and offers temporary hydrophilicity of the hydrophobic chips. Instead, we reduced the dye solution surface tension with surfactant (Tween 20) as done in Shafique H, et al. Lab Chip, 2024.\n",
    "- P200 Micropipettes and tips\n",
    "- Kim-wipes and paper\n",
    "- Gloves\n",
    "- Timer or stopwatch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure (read fully before starting)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Glove Up:** Wear gloves as part of standard lab safety and best practices. All the materials we’re working with, are not really hazardous. That said, it’s still best practice to wear gloves during handling—especially since we have no idea where these pipettes have been! 😊\n",
    "2. **QC:**\n",
    "   - Double-check that all channels are properly sealed with cover tapes and dye solution is mixed before starting\n",
    "   - Work in your petri dish and avoid tipping the chip (the dye may spill and stain whatever it touches)\n",
    "   - You need to ensure there are no bubbles in the cover tape that could bridge two columns in a serpentine, otherwise, the solution may travel through the bubble, not the channel.\n",
    "   - To resolve any bubbles you notice, push them out using a flexible hard edge (such as a husky card).\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images_lab2/bubbles.png\" width=\"1000\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Filling Channels:** Using a P200 pipette, introduce ~30µL of the pre-mixed dye solution into the inlet of one of the six channels. \n",
    "5. **Timing:** Start the timer as soon as the dye solution has started to enter the channel.  \n",
    "6. **Observation:** Monitor the flow of the dye through the channel until it reaches the outlet. \n",
    "7. **Recording:** Record the time taken for each channel to fill. We suggest recording these times both in this notebook (in the table above) AND elsewhere to avoid any data loss. If your channel failed, note the modes of failure. If your dye moves, but does not make it to the end, you can approximate the length it did travel by measuring and recording both drain time and approximate length traveled. \n",
    "8. **Clean Excess Solution:** Once the solution has reached the outlet, you can use paper to collect the drained volume at the outlet. Then proceed to wick up the excess dye at the inlet using a kim-wipe to avoid spilling any solution and dispose of the kim-wipe. \n",
    "9. **Repeat for Replicates:** Repeat the process for each of the channels provided with ~30µL volume introduced at each inlet. Note that channel 3 will take a longer time.\n"

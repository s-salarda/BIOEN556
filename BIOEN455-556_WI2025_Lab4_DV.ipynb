    "### Overview:\n",
    "You will measure and record the drain time of liquids in a CC with domino valves and then calculate flow rates. The CC design is based on Figure 4 (below) from [Leong, K. M., et al. (2024). Democratizing Access to Microfluidics: Rapid Prototyping of Open Microchannels with Low-Cost LCD 3D Printers.ACS Omega](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.4c07776)\n",

We also have provided you space in a table to record drain times and flow rates.  We recommend also writing these measurements down outside of this notebook to avoid any saving issues and loss of data.\n",

    "### Materials\n",
    "- Resin-printed microfluidic chip, plasma treated, and sealed with hydrophobic cover tape (ARseal 90697, Adhesives Research, Glen Rock, Pennsylvania, USA)\n",
    "- Red and yellow dye solutions (13% food dye v/v in DI water). \n",
    "- P20 Micropipettes and tips\n",
    "- Paper pump\n",
    "- Kim wipes (for cleaning up)\n",
    "- Gloves\n",
    "- Timer or stopwatch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure (read fully before starting)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Glove Up:** Wear gloves as part of standard lab safety and best practices. All the materials we’re working with, are not really hazardous. That said, it’s still best practice to wear gloves during handling—especially since we have no idea where these pipettes have been! 😊\n",
    "2. **QC:**\n",
    "   - Double-check that all channels are properly sealed with cover tapes and dye solution is mixed before starting.\n",
    "   - Work in your petri dish and avoid tipping the chip (the dye may spill and stain whatever it touches)\n",
    "3. **Filling Reservoirs:** Using a P20 pipette, introduce 11µL of the **red** dye solution into the inlet of reservoir 1. Introduce 9 µL of the **red** dye solution into the inlet of reservoirs 2-4.\n",
    "4. **Filling Control Channel:** Using a  pipette, introduce 20µL of the **yellow** dye solution into the inlet of the control channel. Note that once you add liquid to the control channel, flow may begin in your first reservoir, so you should be ready with your timer!\n",
    "5. **Paper Pump:** Attach a paper pump to the outlet of the CC if it is not done so already. You may need to put pressure on it so that it connects to the outlet and starts flow. If flow does not start or liquid does not fill the resistor fully, we can help you try and troubleshoot the chip!\n",
    "6. **Timing:** Start the timer as soon as the red dye solution begins draining from each reservoir. We recommend using a lap function to more easily record the time stamps of sequential drainage. Alternatively, you can take a video with your phone of the drainage process and review the footage to obtain time stamps. If you go the video route, ensure you have enough storage to record a full video!\n",
    "7. **Recording:** Record the time taken for each reservoir to drain. We suggest recording these times both in this notebook (in the table below) AND elsewhere to avoid any data loss. If your channel failed, note the modes of failure and mention this in your reflection question 3.\n",
    "8. **Flow Rates:** Using the volumes provided (actual volumes in the reservoirs) and the measured drain times calculate the flow rates for each reservoir.\n",

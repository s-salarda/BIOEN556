    "The objective of this computational lab is to explore the design and behavior of capillaric circuits (CCs), specifically focusing on flow resistors, retention burst valves (RBVs) and trigger valves (TVs), to enable the autonomous and sequential delivery of liquids. **Based on the paper: [Autonomous microfluidic capillaric circuits replicated from 3D-printed molds](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/lc/c6lc00764c)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "From videos of CCs (Olanrewaju et al 2016), you will record the drain time of liquids in reservoirs connected to Retention Burst Valves (RBVs) and Trigger Valves (TVs). You will later calculate the junction pressures, exploring the theory behind using TVs and RBVs for autonomous sequential delivery of four liquids.\n",

The resistance (R) in the system determines the relationship between pressure and flow rate—higher resistance results in lower flow, just as increasing electrical resistance reduces current.

The main exception is Branch 2, which does not follow the expected trend decrease from Branch 1 to 4. This difference is most likely due to uncertainty in the measured drain times, since the video is sped up 20× and the exact moment channel 2 drains is questionable as it appears to start draining before Branch 1 has fully finished. Small variations in channel dimensions, surface properties, or contact angles could also contribute to deviations from the ideal trend."

    "### TO-DO: When all the reservoires are all filled and the system is still in static equillibruim, the junction presures to be equal to each other at each node (P_J1 = P_J2 = PJ_3 = PJ_4). With no flow or fluid moving, there is no pressure drop across the resistors, so the entire network sits at a uniform pressure. This is similar to electrical circuits with the switch off, the voltage is the same everywhere even when no current is floing through the system."

    "### TO-DO: My calculated capillary pressures follow the same trend as Table 1, where the retention burst valve pressure becomes more negative as the valve dimensions decrease. This inverse relationship matches the expected behavior of capillary pressure in microchannels. The numerical values I obtained are also very close to those reported in the table, with their magnitudes aligning almost one‑to‑one with my calculated pressures. Overall, my results are consistent with the published data."

If P_J1 was larger than P_J2 then the flow sequence would be different where valve/channel 1 would flow first. Each P_J sits right below the capillary pressure in each valve which is what determines the draining order. If P_J1 was greater than P_J2 then the sequence would change to where channel 2 would burst before channel 1.\n",
    "### The absolute pressure values I calculated were also similar to the paper and show the same increasing trends as the valve dimensions decrease (Channels 1 to 4). If the absolute pressure values were lowered, the valves would release or burst quicker, making the drain time a lot quicker and possibly disrupting the sequence and timing. If the absolute pressure was 0 then the valves would have no barrier and the entire system would just drain immediately."

    "### TO-DO: In the video, the main reason everything starts draining at different flow rates is because the 6‑loop resistor normally adds a huge flow resistance that sets a pressure threshold the other channels have to overcome before they can start draining. With that resistor in place, the pump has to push against a large resistance, which forces the junction pressures to rise in a controlled way. That’s what keeps the device sequenced to burst in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Without the resistor, the circuit suddenly has a very low‑resistance path. The pressure from the pump distributes unevenly across the branches, and each branch drains according to its own geometry which is seen in the video where moving throug the decreasing sizes, you see a decreased flow rate. The junction pressures no longer follow the required ordering, so the valves don’t burst in sequence even though their pressures are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This ties directly into the design rules: the branch and junction pressures must form a straightforward progression (P_J1 < P_J2 < P_J3 < P_J4) for the circuit to sequence correctly. The resistor is what enforces that structure and when it’s removed, the pressure pattern is distrupted and the entire circuit loses its timing/function."
